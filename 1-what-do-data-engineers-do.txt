If I was hired to enable data analytics,I would try to first understand the domain of the company. 
I would then list out the required and crucial data.
I will talk to the end users and try to understand their requirements.
Next,I will try to devise a method which kkeeps in mind the size of the data and the budget of the company dedicated for the project.
